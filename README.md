# FAMamba-LSTMConvSR

Official Kaggle notebook implementation of **FAMamba-LSTMConvSR**, a
frequency-aware hybrid refocusing framework for ×4 remote sensing image
super-resolution.

## Paper

**Frequency-Aware Hybrid Refocusing for Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution**

Md Khalid Hasan Sakib, Dristi Datta, and Manoranjan Paul.

Paper status: Under review.

## Overview

FAMamba-LSTMConvSR integrates:

- Vision-LSTM-inspired contextual guidance
- Mamba-inspired row-column sequence mixing
- CNN-based local refinement
- Haar-frequency enhancement
- Branch-wise adaptive fusion
- Gated Top-Down Fusion

The training objective combines Charbonnier reconstruction loss,
Haar high-frequency loss, and Sobel edge loss.

## Running the Code

The notebooks were developed for the Kaggle environment.

1. Download the required dataset from the corresponding Kaggle link.
2. Open the relevant notebook in Kaggle.
3. Add the required Kaggle dataset or datasets as notebook inputs.
4. Enable a GPU accelerator.
5. Verify that the dataset paths match those defined in the notebook.
6. Run the notebook cells in order.

The RSSCN7 notebook activates RSSCN7 through:

```python
USE_RSSCN7 = True
USE_UAVID = False
USE_POTSDAM = False
